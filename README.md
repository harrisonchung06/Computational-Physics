##Spring Potential Visualization 
A python project that visualizes three dimensional particles with a spring potential between them using PYQtGraph and OpenGL. 
The user defines:
* X and Y dimensions of the world 
* Z dimensions of the world 
* Number of particles 
* Positions of particles (optional)
* Spring constant 
* Mass of particles 
* Initial Velocities on particles

#PSO Algorithm Visualization 
A python project that visualizes the PSO optimization algorithm on a glassy surface generated with gaussian noise using PyQtGraph and OpenGL. 
The user defines:
* Number of particles 
* Depth below and above zero 
* Step (constant that determines how noisy the surface is)
* Hyperparameters of the algorithm

##Ball Hill Calculator 
A python project that allows users to calculate the parameters associated with the classical Newtonian mechnanics problem of a solid cylinder rolling down a hill with friction. 
The user defines in SI Units: 
* Hypotenuse of the slope 
* Angle of the slope from the horizontal (+x axis) 
* Static friction coefficient 
* Mass of the solid cylinder  
* Radius of the solid cylinder 
* Gravitational acceleration 
* Total simulation timesteps 
* Time of each timestep 

The calculator calculates over time:
* Total Energy 
* Kinetic Energy 
* Rotational Energy 
* Gravitational Potential Energy 
* X position of the cylinder 
* Velocity of the cylinder 
* Rotational Velocity of the cylinder
